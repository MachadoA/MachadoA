Hello, I'm Ana Amaral. ðŸ‘‹

"I began my professional journey with the Professional Specialization course in Front-end Development, which I have already completed. There, I had my first encounters with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, and React Native.

After completing the specialization, I sought further knowledge through various online courses, including those by Gustavo Guanabara, Mateus Batistti, Sujeito Programador, Mouredev, Kevin Powell, among others.

The hands-on experience during my internship provided me with insights into the developer's daily routine, and since then, I have been actively seeking opportunities in the job market.

Currently, I work on personal projects, aiming to blend creativity and functionality to offer user-friendly solutions.

I invite you to explore some of my projects on my GitHub and Frontend Mentor repositories, where you can get a better understanding of my work and coding style. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss potential collaborations, job opportunities, or just to exchange ideas about the fascinating world of front-end development.

Talk to you soon!"
